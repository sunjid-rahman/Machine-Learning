In time_series_forecasting_covid19_bd.ipynb file I did time forecasting of covid-19 confirm cases, death cases and recover cases of Bangladesh. I used SVR, NuSVR,Polynomial linear regression and ARIMA model for forecasting and compare the models and check out which model actually works better by comparing known cases and predicted cases.

In forecast_covid19_prophet.ipynb file I did time forecasting of covid-19 confirm cases, death cases and recover cases of Bangladesh using Facebook Prophet model. Which is actually a better forecasting model for time series forecasting.
